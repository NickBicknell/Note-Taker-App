## Description

I developed the Note Taker App to be able to write and save notes in an easy and accessable way. This application is built with an Express.js back-end and uses uuid to generate unique ID's. The application saves and retrieves the note data from a JSON file and displays it on the front-end notes.html page.

## Installation

## Usage

When you first load up the app you are presented with the homepage/index.html of the Note Taker application with a get started button. Upon button click you are directed to the notes.html page. The notes page is divided into two sections. The left section contains all existing notes. The right section allows the user to input a note title and description. A save button at the top right will appear to save the users new note. Any already existing note can be clicked on to be displayed. Press the + sign at the top right to start a new note.
